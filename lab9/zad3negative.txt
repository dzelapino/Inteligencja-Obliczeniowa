Despite booking and paying for the stay on the spot, it turned out that the place I paid for was occupied and had been rented to someone else.
After booking, it turned out that the price given on the booking is not a real price, after booking and paying, I was informed that I would have to pay an additional fee for the stay.
Despite booking and paying for the stay, I was sent back with a receipt and the money was not refunded for the booking.
The lady did not even deign to inform you that there would be no place for us for which it was paid.
I do not recommend this place, it is a waste of time and money, I did not even hear from the owners of the premises. Sorry for the fact that I stayed with my hand in the potty without an overnight stay.
